# Overview

This script creates a minimal install of Ubuntu 20.04 for Nvidia Jetson.

# Optional Features
1. Automatic repartitioning to SD card size
2. LXDE Desktop Environment
3. Force a GCC version

# Flashing an image:

1. Flash the image that was generated by one of the following methods onto your Jetson's SD card with any flashing software (I like Balena Etcher because it has a great UI and will automatically decompress files )

# Downloading the prebuild image:

1. Download jetson_image.img.xz from the releases page ( This image uses the default configuration, which may not be what you want. If you want something else, use one of the following methods to create your own image )

# Creating an image ( Using GitHub actions ):

1. Fork the repository
2. Configure the variables at the top of the create_image.sh script
3. Wait for GitHub actions to finish ( ~20 minutes with default settings )
4. Download the image by clicking on the Actions tab, then the most recent workflow run, then the image artifact
5. ( optional ) If you want the file to be publicly accessible or if you want a smaller download size, you can manually dispatch the release action ( under the release workflow in the actions tab ), which will create a release with the image compressed in a .xz file ( the required "tag" field in the dispatch menu is the name of the release, so like v0.1 )

# Creating an image ( On your Debian-based machine ):

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AlistairKeiller/jetson
```
2. cd into the repository:
```bash
cd jetson
```
3. Configure the variables at the top of the create_image.sh script
4. Run the script with root permissions:
```bash
sudo bash create_image.sh
```
5. create_image.sh will create the image at ./jetson_image.img

# Script Credits:

https://github.com/pythops/jetson-nano-image has been an amazing resource for which packages are necessary or useful. I created this project instead of using Pythop's script because I wanted a fast and convenient way to get a fully configured desktop and so I could learn in the process.
